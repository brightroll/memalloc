OLD NOTES

- attempt 1, simple attempt to use dlsym, infinite recursion
- attempt 2, used ELF/GCC linker --wrap option, infinite recursion
- attempt 3, used glibc malloc hooks, mostly working
             used my trick to avoid LD_PRELOAD
             discovered that I cannot use freed memory for book keeping,
             overlapped with malloc's book keeping
- attempt 4, working

FUTURE
- look at old dlea's allocator and use sbrk
